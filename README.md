# Beatblock Mod

This is a really crappy and goofy mod for Beatblock because I don't even know Lua

First of its kind! (I think)

**UPDATE:** The first beatblock mod is actually a Korean/Japanese translation (https://github.com/Kedr2806/beatblock-unofficial-translation-ko). However, this is the first one to modify the game's code and levels.

Open run.bat to run it (on Windows). You need Lua and Love2D to run.

This game is not developed by me, it is made by Bubble Tabby Ltd. I will take down this repository on request of them. (Original Game: Beatblock Demo)
